👋 Welcome, Fellow ECE Students & Engineers!

This is my open archive of notes, code, and resources from my Electrical and Computer Engineering journey.

Purpose: My goal is to create a helpful resource for students tackling the same challenging topics I did, while also building a public record of my projects. Whether you're studying for an exam, looking for project inspiration, or reviewing core concepts, I hope you find this collection useful.

What's Inside? The repository includes materials on subjects like:

Circuits & Electronics

Digital Logic & FPGAs

Signals & Systems

Microcontrollers & Embedded C

Communications & Control Systems

Let's Collaborate! This is a living repository, updated as I complete new courses and projects. Feel free to explore, use responsibly for your studies, and contribute fixes or suggestions via pull requests. Questions or found a bug? Please open an Issue.

Disclaimer: This content is provided "as-is" for educational inspiration and reference. Always complete your own academic work and adhere to your school's honor code. Verify all concepts and code before implementation.
