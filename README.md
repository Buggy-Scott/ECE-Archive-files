Welcome to my open ECE archive! Explore code, lab reports, and notes from my electrical engineering courses—circuits, embedded systems, EM Waves, and more. I built this as a study reference and project showcase. Use it to complement your learning. Always honor your school's academic integrity policy. Updated often!
